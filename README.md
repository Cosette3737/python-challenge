The Pypoll challenge analyzed a dataset of votes for candidates.  The dataset uses Voter ID, County, and Candidate.  The only useful information needed for the analysis was the candidates.  Using the candidate column, we can find a total sum of all votes, and a breakdown of each candidate.  Using this information, we can find percentages for each candidate.  The total vote count is 3521001, and the leader is Khan with 63 percent.  Election breakdown lists Candidate, percentage, and number of votes.  Using this dataset can show that not all information is pertinent, and we can use one column to determine a lot of information.  

PyBank uses a dataset that has two columns, Dates and Profit/Loss.  This dataset gives us information for the cycling of the profit and what it means.  We can use the dates to figure out a count and label the greatest increase /degrease in profits.  The profit loss column allows us to determine the average change during he period recorded by suing the total amount of months, and the total of profit losses.  By looking at each time frame, we can look to see the change in between each month and determine the changes through the dataset.  This allows us to pinpoint the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits.  Using the columns, we can see the greatest increase and the time frame
